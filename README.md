# gds-xaringan

_In development_

This repo contains CSS files and an R Markdown template for mimicking GDS's Google Slides presentation template.

They're implemented using the [{xaringan}](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/), which provides an implementation of [remark.js](https://github.com/gnab/remark) through R Markdown.

What's the point? You can create presentations that meet GDS's standards and, crucially, include and run R code.
